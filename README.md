# TicTacToeInfinite-Java-Swing
Expandable Tic Tac Toe Game using the Java Swing library

To play compile this in a java compiler (I used eclipse) and run. This is a tic tic toe game that can have a 30 by 30 board (can't see pieces after 30 by 30 board) and you control the amount of pieces in a row needed to win, you can play with an "AI" or another player. Use the console to play.
 
Sorry for any spaghetti code this was made in my sophomore year of high school, so feel free to modify it. Also feel free to view any other projects I made.
